This Project will be a application that will be using TheMealDB api and will allow user to browse through premade recipes and allow User to also add their own recipes. The user then will be able to save their favorite recipes onto a local database and be able to perform all CRUD methods on it.

## App Components

### Creating Items
Creating recipes and adding them to your favorites

### Deleting Items
deleting from favorites list

### Editing Items
editing from favorites list

### Getting Items
gaining from local database.


## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method. 

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. 

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| HomePage | H | 3hrs| 6hrs | 5hrs |
| Api Calling/ Recipes Browsing | H | 10hrs| 12hrs | 12hrs |
| Favorites List | H | 5hrs| 2hrs | |
| User Authentication | m | 10hrs| | |
| Bootstrap | l | 10hrs| 12hrs | |
| Facebook/Google login | l | 5hrs|  |  |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string |
