# Definition
Simply put, plagiarism involves both stealing someone else's work or idea and lying about it afterward; an act of cheating.  Plagiarized work includes turning in code that you didn’t write or building someone else’s idea without giving credit.  As broken down by Plagiarism.org, to “plagiarize” is to:
* Steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own
* Use (another's production) without crediting the source
* Commit literary or code theft
* Present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source

# Policy
General Assembly has a **zero tolerance policy** towards plagiarism and cheating.  It is destructive to classroom culture, and exhibits a clear lack of respect for classmates, instructors, the company, and the greater community.  Any work considered to have been plagiarised will not be accepted and will not count towards graduation requirements.  If a project exhibits evidence of plagiarism or cheating, the student will not be able to display the project at a GA-sponsored class “science fair” or “meet & greet.”  Any student found plagiarising or attempting to plagiarise will be disciplined accordingly (including but not limited to removal from class).

Open source code is inherently open and usually available for free use to modify and implement into any non-commercial project.  However, please review their license and usage guidelines, give credit to the project and/or author, and do not try to hide or disguise the usage of such code.

All of the following are considered plagiarism or cheating:
* Turning in work that is not your own.
* Turning in someone else's work as your own.
* Hiring, or paying someone to do your work for you.
* Copying words or code without giving credit.
* Building or copying someone else’s idea without their knowledge or giving credit.
* Giving incorrect information about a source.
* Changing words, variable names, etc. but copying the code or files of a source without giving credit.
* Copying so many ideas or code blocks from a source that it makes up the majority of your work, whether you give credit or not.
* Failing to put a quotation in quotation marks.

### NOTES:
* A source can be considered anything found on the internet (i.e. Stack Overflow, GitHub, etc.), an instructor, or another classmate.
* Plagiarism is NOT the same as copyright infringement

# How to avoid plagiarism
* Don’t copy a classmate’s work by looking at their published work, homework repository, works in progress, or looking at their screen.  If you need help, ask for it.
* Don’t build an idea that is not yours without the source’s prior knowledge and consent.
* Check for a project’s license.  Some common ones include MIT License, Creative Commons, and GNU GPL.
* Give credit to the code you’ve borrowed or adapted.  At a minimum, put a link to the source in a code comment.
* GA expects all course students to be able to explain the usage, meaning, and/or implementation of any code submitted and declared work of the student.
* If you’re ever in doubt or unsure, talk to your instructor.

# Examples of Plagiarism
* Looking over someone’s shoulder and copying what they have done.
* Paying or asking someone to do your work for you.
* Implementing a CSS framework like Skeleton, but renaming some classes and keywords to pass it off as your own.
